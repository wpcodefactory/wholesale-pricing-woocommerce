Set WooCommerce product prices depending on quantity in cart.

== Description ==

**Product Price by Quantity for WooCommerce** plugin lets you set WooCommerce product pricing rules, when product price depends on product **quantity in cart**.

### &#9989; Main Features ###

* You can implement popular **"buy more pay less"** pricing, as well as less common **"buy more pay more"** pricing.
* Pricing rules can be set **for all products**, or on **per product basis**.
* You can use **total cart quantity** or **product quantity**.
* Optionally you can set to apply wholesale discount only **if no other cart discounts were applied**.
* Discounts can be set as **percent** from the original price, **fixed** discount, or set **price directly** on per product basis.
* Additionally you can set different product price by quantity options for different **user roles**. Also, the plugin includes tool for creating custom user roles.
* If you want to display prices table on frontend, use `[alg_wc_ppq_table]` and/or `[alg_wc_product_ppq_table]` **shortcodes**.
* The plugin also has option to **display price by quantity in real time**, i.e., when customer changes product quantity on single product page.
* You can also optionally use **formulas** and **custom product fields** in level "Min quantity" and "Discount" options.
* The plugin is **"High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS)"** compatible.
* And more...
