Introducing Quantity Dynamic Pricing & Bulk Discounts for WooCommerce plugin, the game-changer your store needs.
Tired of manual price adjustments? Our plugin empowers you to effortlessly implement quantity discounts, tiered/volume pricing, and dynamic pricing strategies with ease.

Picture this: You've got a range of products in your store, each offering different price points depending on the quantity purchased. But managing these bulk discounts by coupons or -worse- manually  can be a headache, leading to inconsistencies and missed opportunities. That's where our plugin steps in.

Whether you prefer to base discounts on total cart quantity or individual product quantity, our plugin caters to your needs. Plus, you have the option to apply wholesale discounts only when no other cart discounts are present. Choose from a range of discount types, including percentage discounts, fixed discounts, or set prices per product, and much more.

## 🚀 Main Features: FREE Version##

### 🚀 Flexible Dynamic Pricing Strategies ###

Implement popular "buy more pay less" or less common "buy more pay more" pricing strategies.
For example, offer discounts for purchasing multiple units of a product.

### 🚀 Customizable Pricing Rules: By Product or at Once ###

Exercise granular control over pricing rules, allowing you to set rules for all products or customize them on a per-product basis for maximum flexibility.

### 🚀 Cart vs. Product Quantity Discount ###

Determine whether discounts should be based on total cart quantity or individual product quantity, ensuring discounts are applied according to your preferred criteria.
For example, offer a $5 discount per unit for Product A or a 10% discount on the total cart quantity exceeding 10 units.

### 🚀 Select When to Apply Discount ###

Decide whether quantity discounts & dynamic prices should only apply when no other cart discounts are present to prevent conflicting discount scenarios and/or mis-using your promotions.

### 🚀 Multiple Discounts Types ###

Choose from a variety of discounting methods, including percentage discounts, fixed discounts, or direct price adjustments per product, to suit your pricing strategy.

### 🚀 Apply Discounts by User Role ###

Tailor pricing options based on user roles, enabling you to create custom pricing structures for different user segments and enhance customer segmentation strategies.

### 🚀 Show Tiered Prices Table on Product Page ###

The free version allows displaying price tables on the frontend using simple shortcodes like `[alg_wc_ppq_table]` and `[alg_wc_product_ppq_table]`, so that you can provide transparent pricing information to your customers for informed purchasing decisions.

### 🚀 Show Saving & Discounts for Products in Cart ###

Show discount pricing information alongside each cart item, you can also utilize placeholders like `discount_percent`, `new_price_single`, and `old_price_single` to provide detailed insights into discounts applied to each item in the cart.

### 🚀 Show Total Price by Quantity in Real-Time ###

Instantly showcase the “Total Price by Quantity” on the product page and make prices clear based on the chosen quantity, you can also select to show the dynamic price instead/after/before the default standard price.
For example, on a $10 product where you sell it at $9 for quantities 20 & above, when a customer select quantity of 15, it shows $150 for 15 %unit%, and when they go 20, it shows $180 for 20 %unit%.

### 🚀 WCFM & WPML Compatible ###

* Multi-currency support with WordPress Multilingual (WPML) plugin, enabling you to display prices in multiple currencies to cater to an international customer base.
* Compatible with WCFM Marketplace to allow vendors to create tiered pricing strategies.
* High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) compatible

### 🚀 Admin Tools ###

**Delete All Settings:**
The plugin has a small tool where you can delete all "per product" settings & values for your entire store, as well as deleting plugin values of product categories & tags.

**Reports:**
In a simple & organized view, you can see all dynamic prices you've applied to your products, product categories, or tags.
